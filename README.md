# Provision NFTs
The Provision NFT marketplace allows designers to put their works for a low fee, and individuals can purchase them at reasonable prices.

## Problem description
NFT markets are great for trading art, but there is no system or algorithm that guarantees the quality of the work people post on them. New items deposited in the gallery of a NFT market place are they valuable, are they copied from other places, and will people purchase them?

## Solution description
In the NFT market, Layer two technologies offer incredibly low fees for putting and trading art. Additionally, we can distinguish between low-level and masterpiece works through the use of logical algorithms.
